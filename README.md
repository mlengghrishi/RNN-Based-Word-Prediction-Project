# ðŸ”¤ RNN-Based Word Prediction Project
Project Overview

The RNN-Based Word Prediction Project focuses on building a language model that predicts the next word in a sentence given a sequence of previous words. This forms the foundation of many NLP applications such as autocomplete, chatbots, machine translation, and speech recognition.

Using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) â€” and their advanced variants like LSTMs (Long Short-Term Memory) and GRUs (Gated Recurrent Units) â€” the project demonstrates how models can capture temporal dependencies and contextual meaning in text data.

Dataset

Datasets can be sourced from:

Text corpora such as Wikipedia, Project Gutenberg (books), or news articles.

Custom datasets (chat logs, song lyrics, movie scripts).

Preloaded datasets from Keras (imdb, reuters, or other text datasets).

Structure:

Field	Description
Text Data	Sentences or documents forming the training corpus

The dataset is usually converted into word sequences (sliding windows) for supervised training.

Objectives

Preprocess raw text into tokens and numerical sequences.

Train an RNN-based language model to predict the next word.

Experiment with LSTM and GRU for better long-term dependency handling.

Evaluate prediction accuracy and perplexity.

Generate coherent sentences or paragraphs as a demo.

Methodology / Steps
1. Data Preprocessing

Tokenization (NLTK / Keras tokenizer).

Lowercasing, punctuation removal.

Vocabulary creation & word-to-index mapping.

Padding/truncating sequences.

Train-test split.

2. Model Architecture

Embedding Layer â€“ converts words into dense vector representations.

RNN / LSTM / GRU layers â€“ capture sequence dependencies.

Dense + Softmax output layer â€“ predicts probability distribution over vocabulary.

Example:

Input: "Artificial intelligence is"  
Output: "future" (highest probability word predicted)  

3. Training

Loss Function: Categorical Cross-Entropy

Optimizer: Adam / RMSprop

Batch Training with sliding windows of sequences

4. Evaluation Metrics

Accuracy: Correctly predicted next words.

Perplexity (PPL): Measures how well the model predicts sequences.

5. Deployment / Demo

Interactive word suggestion system (like autocomplete).

Generate random sentences given a seed text.

Optional: Deploy with Flask/Streamlit for live demos.

Applications

Text Autocomplete (mobile keyboards, Google search suggestions).

Chatbots â€“ generating conversational replies.

Creative Writing â€“ assist in writing poems, lyrics, or stories.

Speech Recognition â€“ predicting next likely words to improve transcription.

Deliverables

Preprocessed dataset with tokenized sequences.

Trained RNN/LSTM/GRU-based language model.
